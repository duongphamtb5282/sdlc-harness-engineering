Agent Skills and hooks for maintaining high-quality open-source Python packages - an agentic engineering setup covering linting, testing, packaging, releases, and CI quality gates.

Agent Skills for [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills) (and any
[Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io)-compatible tool). Each skill is a folder under
[`skills/`](skills/) with a single-purpose `SKILL.md`, trigger evals, and optional
scripts/references — validated on every write, commit, and PR.

## Quick start

Install with the [skills CLI](https://skills.sh) — auto-detects 70+ agents
(Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Copilot, pi, …):

```bash
npx skills add Paldom/python-skills                  # all detected agents
npx skills add Paldom/python-skills -a codex -a pi   # or target specific agents
```

Or with the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_skill_install) (≥ 2.90),
including version-pinned installs from releases:

```bash
gh skill install Paldom/python-skills
gh skill install Paldom/python-skills <skill> --pin v0.2.0
```

Or as a Claude Code plugin:

```
/plugin marketplace add Paldom/python-skills
/plugin install python-skills@python-skills
```

Or copy a single skill into a project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Paldom/python-skills.git
cp -r python-skills/skills/<skill-name> your-project/.claude/skills/
```

Then just describe the task in Claude Code — the skill activates on its description —
or invoke it explicitly with `/<skill-name>`.

To apply **all** skills to a project in one orchestrated run (baseline audit →
parallel subagents → verified PR), paste the ready-made prompt from
[docs/setup-prompt.md](docs/setup-prompt.md).

## Skills

| Skill | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [python-lint](skills/python-lint/) | Sets up and tunes Ruff linting and formatting — `[tool.ruff]` rule selection, Black/Flake8/isort migration — and fixes lint or format failures. |
| [python-typing](skills/python-typing/) | Sets up static type checking — choosing mypy, pyright, or ty, strict configuration, per-module overrides, shipping `py.typed` — and fixes type-check errors. |
| [python-testing](skills/python-testing/) | Builds pytest infrastructure — layout and config, branch-coverage gates, Hypothesis property-based tests, mutation testing, multi-version runs via tox/nox/uv. |
| [python-packaging](skills/python-packaging/) | Configures packaging — pyproject.toml metadata, build backend choice, src layout, uv project management, building and verifying wheels and sdists. |
| [python-release](skills/python-release/) | Cuts and automates releases — version bumps, changelogs, git tags, PyPI trusted publishing (OIDC), and the tag-triggered publish workflow with a gated environment. |
| [python-ci](skills/python-ci/) | Authors GitHub Actions quality gates — lint/type/test matrices, uv caching, an all-checks-passed aggregator, required checks, rulesets, action SHA pinning. |
| [python-precommit](skills/python-precommit/) | Configures pre-commit — ruff, mypy, hygiene, commit-message and pre-push hooks, plus non-Python file formatting and validation, kept in sync with CI. |
| [python-supply-chain](skills/python-supply-chain/) | Hardens the supply chain — Dependabot with cooldown, pip-audit, secret scanning and push protection, CodeQL, Scorecard, SBOMs, CODEOWNERS. |
| [agent-guardrails](skills/agent-guardrails/) | Installs agentic guardrails — Claude Code hooks with the exit-code contract, a Stop gate that signs off only what the repo's pre-commit would accept, AGENTS.md rules files, vetted public skills — and troubleshoots hooks. |

Together they implement a layered enforcement architecture for agent-era Python
maintenance: agent hooks (instant feedback) → pre-commit (commit gate) → CI +
rulesets (the authoritative, un-bypassable layer).

## Repository structure

```
skills/                  # distributed skills, one folder per skill (SKILL.md + evals/ + scripts/)
docs/                    # skill-authoring guide, eval methodology, deployment guide
skills.sh.json           # skills.sh repo-page customization (groupings)
scripts/                 # deterministic validator used by hooks and CI
.claude/                 # agentic dev setup: hooks + bundled add-skill / publish-repo skills
.claude-plugin/          # plugin + marketplace manifests (makes this repo installable)
.local/                  # gitignored working area: sources, research, PROMPT.md (see below)
```

## Working on this repo with an agent

This repo is agent-native: canonical agent instructions live in
[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) (CLAUDE.md imports it), hooks validate every `SKILL.md` on
write, `make check` runs the full validator, and CI enforces the same gate on every
PR. The bundled `add-skill` skill walks the eval-first authoring workflow described
in [docs/skill-authoring.md](docs/skill-authoring.md). Maintainers drive sessions
with their own (gitignored, personal) `.local/PROMPT.md` goal prompt.
