description: Authors or improves an Agent Skill in this repo via the eval-first workflow - scope one purpose, write trigger evals, draft SKILL.md, validate, iterate. Use when the user asks to create, add, write, refine, or fix a skill ("add a skill for X", "improve triggering of Y"). Not for scaffolding a new repository or editing infrastructure (hooks, CI, the validator/scripts, docs).

# add-skill

Builds one production-quality skill in `skills/<name>/`, eval-first. Read
`docs/skill-authoring.md` and `docs/evals.md` once per session before starting;
they are the rulebook this workflow enforces. If invoked as `/add-skill <args>`,
treat `$ARGUMENTS` as the skill name or idea to scope in step 1.

## When NOT to use

- Creating a new skills *repository* → that happens in the workspace above this repo.
- Infrastructure work (hooks, CI, validator, docs) → plain editing, PR-level scrutiny.
- A "skill" that merely restates what the model already does well → don't build it;
  a skill must fix a specific observed failure.

## Workflow

1. **Scope.** State in one sentence what the skill does and the concrete failure it
   fixes. If the sentence needs "and", split into multiple skills and do them one at
   a time. Check `skills/` and the README catalog for overlap — near-neighbor
   descriptions steal each other's triggers; adjust scope or plan disjoint wording.
2. **Gather.** Read `.local/` recursively — every subfolder and file is source
   material (research, examples, constraints). Then research beyond it: web-search
   the topic for current facts, official docs, and prior art; verify anything
   load-bearing against primary sources, and cross-validate contested or
   high-stakes facts (external APIs, schemas, security claims) with /cross when
   available. Verified facts a skill depends on go into `skills/<name>/references/`
   as cleaned, tracked files — never cite `.local/` paths from a skill.
3. **Evals first.** Create `skills/<name>/evals/evals.json` per `docs/evals.md`:
   ≥8 `should_trigger` (vary formality, typos, terseness), ≥8 `should_not_trigger`
   (near-misses sharing keywords), 3–5 `quality` cases with plain-language
   `expected_behavior` assertions. If you can't write these, the scope is unclear —
   go back to step 1.
4. **Draft SKILL.md.** Frontmatter: `name` == folder name; `description` on a
   **single line**, third person, `[what] + [use when …] + [not for …]`, 150–400
   chars, trigger keywords in the first ~120. Body per the structure in
   `docs/skill-authoring.md`: purpose → when/when-not → numbered workflow → output
   spec → gotchas → pointers. Under 500 lines; deterministic steps as `scripts/`
   (non-zero exit on failure); long material as `references/` with a TOC.
5. **Validate.** `make check` must exit 0. The write-time hook already validated the
   file; fix every error and triage every warning it printed.
6. **Trigger self-test.** For at least 3 should-trigger and 2 should-not-trigger
   prompts, reason explicitly: would the description alone (not the body) route this
   prompt here, against every other skill in the catalog? Fix the description, not
   the evals. Recommend the user run 2–3 fresh-session probes for the riskiest cases.
7. **Register.** Add/update the skill's row in the README catalog table, add a
   `CHANGELOG.md` entry, and put the skill in exactly one `skills.sh.json`
   grouping (engaging one-sentence group descriptions — that file is the repo's
   skills.sh listing copy). Re-check descriptions of sibling skills for new
   overlap. Do **not** commit or push — leave all changes for the owner to review.

## Output spec (Definition of Done)

- `skills/<name>/` with SKILL.md + evals/evals.json (+ scripts/references as needed)
- `make check` → 0 errors; README catalog + CHANGELOG updated
- A 3-line summary: purpose, trigger phrase examples, known limitations

## Gotchas

- Keep `description` on ONE physical line — multi-line values have failed to load
  in some runtimes and the validator blocks them; never work around the validator.
- Don't paste failed eval prompts verbatim into the description (overfitting);
  generalize the missing verb/noun instead.
- Over-triggering fix = add targeted "Not for …" noun phrases from the actual
  false-positive overlap; don't delete positive triggers.
- Model upgrades shift routing — note in your summary that evals should be re-run
  after the next model release.
