# Comprehensive PR Review

Run a comprehensive pull request review using multiple specialized agents, each focusing on a different aspect of code quality.

**Review Aspects (optional):** "$ARGUMENTS"

## Review Workflow:

1. **Determine Review Scope**
   - Check git status to identify changed files
   - Parse arguments to see if user requested specific review aspects
   - Default: Run all applicable reviews

2. **Available Review Aspects:**

   - **comments** - Analyze code comment accuracy and maintainability
   - **tests** - Review test coverage quality and completeness
   - **errors** - Check error handling for silent failures
   - **types** - Analyze type design and invariants (if new types added)
   - **code** - General code review for project guidelines
   - **simplify** - Simplify code for clarity and maintainability
   - **all** - Run all applicable reviews (default)

3. **Identify Changed Files**
   - Run `git diff --name-only` to see modified files
   - Check if PR already exists: `gh pr view`
   - Identify file types and what reviews apply

4. **Determine Applicable Reviews**

   Based on changes:
   - **Always applicable**: code-reviewer (general quality)
   - **If test files changed**: pr-test-analyzer
   - **If comments/docs added**: comment-analyzer
   - **If error handling changed**: silent-failure-hunter
   - **If types added/modified**: type-design-analyzer
   - **After passing review**: code-simplifier (polish and refine)

5. **Launch review perspectives**

   Load wave references from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/agents/code-reviewer/references/` — **not** plugin subagents from `plugins/delivery-toolkit/pr-review-toolkit/reference/agents/`. See `skills/_shared/protocols/agent-separation.md`.

   | Aspect | Reference file |
   |--------|----------------|
   | code (general) | `general-review-framework.md` or dispatch **Code Reviewer** agent |
   | tests | `pr-test-analyzer.md` |
   | comments | `comment-analyzer.md` |
   | errors | `silent-failure-hunter.md` |
   | types | `type-design-analyzer.md` |
   | simplify | `code-simplifier.md` |

   Use `Agent()` with **Code Reviewer** role and the matching reference file in the prompt.

6. **Aggregate Results**

   After agents complete, summarize:
   - **Critical Issues** (must fix before merge)
   - **Important Issues** (should fix)
   - **Suggestions** (nice to have)
   - **Positive Observations** (what's good)

7. **Provide Action Plan**

   Organize findings:
   ```markdown
   # PR Review Summary

   ## Critical Issues (X found)
   - [agent-name]: Issue description [file:line]

   ## Important Issues (X found)
   - [agent-name]: Issue description [file:line]

   ## Suggestions (X found)
   - [agent-name]: Suggestion [file:line]

   ## Strengths
   - What's well-done in this PR

   ## Recommended Action
   1. Fix critical issues first
   2. Address important issues
   3. Consider suggestions
   4. Re-run review after fixes
   ```

## Usage Examples:

**Full review (default):**
```
/pr-review-toolkit:review-pr
```

**Specific aspects:**
```
/pr-review-toolkit:review-pr tests errors
# Reviews only test coverage and error handling

/pr-review-toolkit:review-pr comments
# Reviews only code comments

/pr-review-toolkit:review-pr simplify
# Simplifies code after passing review
```

**Parallel review:**
```
/pr-review-toolkit:review-pr all parallel
# Launches all agents in parallel
```

## Review perspectives (canonical references)

All perspectives live under `agents/code-reviewer/references/`:

**comment-analyzer.md** — comment accuracy, rot, documentation completeness

**pr-test-analyzer.md** — behavioral test coverage, gaps, test quality

**silent-failure-hunter.md** — silent failures, catch blocks, error logging

**type-design-analyzer.md** — type encapsulation, invariants

**general-review-framework.md** — five-axis review (correctness, readability, architecture, security, performance)

**code-simplifier.md** — simplify complex code, preserve behavior

## Tips:

- **Run early**: Before creating PR, not after
- **Focus on changes**: Agents analyze git diff by default
- **Address critical first**: Fix high-priority issues before lower priority
- **Re-run after fixes**: Verify issues are resolved
- **Use specific reviews**: Target specific aspects when you know the concern

## Workflow Integration:

**Before committing:**
```
1. Write code
2. Run: /pr-review-toolkit:review-pr code errors
3. Fix any critical issues
4. Commit
```

**Before creating PR:**
```
1. Stage all changes
2. Run: /pr-review-toolkit:review-pr all
3. Address all critical and important issues
4. Run specific reviews again to verify
5. Create PR
```

**After PR feedback:**
```
1. Make requested changes
2. Run targeted reviews based on feedback
3. Verify issues are resolved
4. Push updates
```

## Notes:

- Agents run autonomously and return detailed reports
- Each agent focuses on its specialty for deep analysis
- Results are actionable with specific file:line references
- Agents use appropriate models for their complexity
- All agents available in `/agents` list
